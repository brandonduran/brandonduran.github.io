<p> The effective radiative forcing from aerosol-cloud interactions (ERF<sub>ACI</sub>) remains one of the biggest uncertainties in our understanding of the climate system. Recently,
  <a href="https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/23/13125/2023/">Casey Wall</a> and co-authors used a new technique to diagnose ERF<sub>ACI</sub> from liquid-topped clouds using MODIS liquid-water path (LWP) x cloud droplet effective radius (r<sub>eff</sub>) joint histograms, in an approach adapted from 
  <a href="https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/clim/26/14/jcli-d-12-00555.1.xml"> Zelinka et al. (2013)</a>.
  We extend this work by diagnosing ERF<sub>ACI</sub> in 5 CMIP6 models, yielding new estimates for the Twomey Effect, LWP adjustment, and cloud fraction (CF) adjustment. 
  Despite significant variability in each of the three components across the ensemble, we find that the magnitude of the global-mean Twomey effect and LWP adjustment are strongly controlled by the model mean-state liquid cloud fraction. 
  Our finding hints at a potential emergent constraint on 2 components of ERFaci, which we hope to explore in a larger ensemble.
  Models with too few liquid clouds in their base state may be underestimating the strength of the Twomey effect and LWP adjustment. </p>
