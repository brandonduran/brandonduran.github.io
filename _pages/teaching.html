  <div class="description"> The effective radiative forcing from aerosol-cloud interactions (ERF<sub>ACI</sub>) remains one of the biggest uncertainties in our understanding of the climate system. 
    We use MODIS satellite simulator output to diagnose ERF<sub>ACI</sub> in 5 CMIP6 models, yielding estimates for the Twomey Effect, LWP adjustment, and cloud fraction (CF) adjustment. 
    The magnitude of the global-mean Twomey effect and LWP adjustment are strongly controlled by the model mean-state liquid cloud fraction. 
    Our finding hints at a potential emergent constraint on 2 components of ERFaci, which we hope to explore in a larger ensemble.
    Models with too few liquid clouds in their base state may be underestimating the strength of the Twomey effect and LWP adjustment. </div>

<h2 style="font-family:sans-serif; font-size: 20.0;" >Aerosol-Ice-Cloud Interactions in a PPE</h2>
<div class="align-image">
  <div class="description">
    Aerosol-ice-cloud interactions are relatively understudied and poorly quantified in models. In a CAM6 PPE, an overall cooling effect from ERFaci<sub>ice</sub> is estimated to be -0.43 Wm<sup>-2</sup>. Strong negative 
      forcing from shifts to smaller ice crystals and increases in ice cloud extent over anthropogenic regions dominates the total response, 
      but loss of high clouds over the tropical Pacific occurs in a pristine aerosol environment. We propose a pathway that relates aerosol-induced subtropical 
      low cloud changes to tropical ice cloud changes via changes in boundary layer moisture. These findings suggest that the modeled ice cloud response to aerosols can be either aerosol or dynamics-driven.

<h2 style="font-family:sans-serif; font-size: 20.0;" >Decomposing Cloud Radiative Feedbacks by Cloud-Top Phase</h2>
<div class="align-image">
  <div class="description" style="font-family:Lato,sans-serif; font-size: 11.0;"> Changes in cloud scattering properties and emissivity that arise from warming cause substantial radiative feedbacks,
      and the relative importance of the underlying mechanisms is poorly understood. One leading hypothesis is that ice-to-liquid conversions cause clouds
      to optically thicken, producing a major negative feedback. By developing a method to decompose cloud radiative feedbacks by cloud-top phase, we find that the global mean of the net cloud scattering
      and emissivity feedback from cloud-phase conversions ranges from −0.17 to −0.01 Wm<sup>-2</sup> K<sup>-1</sup>, while the overall net cloud feedback ranges from 0.02 to 0.91 Wm<sup>-2</sup> K<sup>-1</sup>.
      The multi-model mean of the cloud scattering and emissivity feedback from cloud-phase conversions is approximately 19% of the magnitude of the multi-model mean of the overall
      cloud feedback (−0.10 Wm<sup>-2</sup> K<sup>-1</sup> vs. 0.52 Wm<sup>-2</sup> K<sup>-1</sup>). These results indicate that cloud-phase conversions cause a robust negative feedback by changing cloud scattering and emissivity,
      but this mechanism makes a modest contribution to the overall cloud feedback at the global scale. </div>
