    We use MODIS satellite simulator output and cloud radiative kernels to diagnose ERF<sub>ACI</sub> in 5 CMIP6 models, yielding estimates for the
      Twomey Effect, LWP adjustment, and cloud fraction (CF) adjustment. 
    The magnitude of the global-mean Twomey effect and LWP adjustment are strongly controlled by the model mean-state liquid cloud fraction. 
    Our finding hints at a potential emergent constraint on 2 components of ERFaci, which we hope to explore in a larger ensemble.
    Models with too few liquid clouds in their base state may be underestimating the strength of the Twomey effect and LWP adjustment.
