<h2 class="research-header" >Code for the MODIS cloud radiative kernel (CRK) method</h2>
<div class="align-image">
  <div class="description"> 
    The MODIS cloud radiative kernel decomposition of SW ERFaci requires implementation of the new joint histogram diagnostics in a GCM, as well as 
    a Python script that performs the decomposition. To update your GCM to include the new r<sub>e</sub>-CWP joint histogram diagnostics, the source file that interfaces with COSP
    should be modified <a href="https://github.com/E3SM-Project/E3SM/pull/6407/files">(view minimum code changes here)</a>. The code to perform the decomposition of SW ERFaci from ice
    clouds can be found <a href="https://github.com/brandonduran/modisIceACI">here</a>, and the code to conduct the decomposition for liquid clouds can be found 
    <a href="https://github.com/brandonduran/modis_cloud_radiative_kernels">here</a>. The <a href="https://github.com/CFMIP/COSPv2.0">COSP</a> code changes necessary for the MODIS joint histograms should be available in 
    the master branch or tags>=v2.1.8
