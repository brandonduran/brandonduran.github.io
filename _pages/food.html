<p>I've always been in the kitchen since I was little, although I like to think my skills have improved slightly since I was about 5.
I find tremendous joy in the act of baking and cooking, but it's sharing food with others that I cherish most. I've spent many hours
watching food videos on YouTube: J. Kenji LÃ³pez-Alt is one of my favorites, with his headcam giving you a unique
  1st-person <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/JKenjiLopezAlt">POV</a>. Here are just a few of my creations from recent months
 (food photography skills are still a work-in-progress).</p>
