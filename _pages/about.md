This is my personal site!

I am currently in my final year as an undergraduate at Georgetown University, studying both physics and computer science. Most recently, I spent Summer 2021 participating in the Earth Science on Volcanic Islands NSF-REU through the University of Hawai'i at MƒÅnoa, where I was extremely fortunate to get my introduction to paleoclimate under the supervision of Dr. Sloan Coats. My final project PIDGM can be seen here: https://pidgm.github.io/index.html . I recently presented my work at the 2021 Council on Undergraduate Research (CUR) symposium, and will also be presenting at the 2021 AGU Fall Meeting.

Outside of school, I enjoy baking, running, hiking, and watching soccer.
