I am a fourth-year PhD Candidate in the Climate Sciences (CS) program at Scripps Institution of Oceanography interested in aerosol-cloud interactions and their representation in large-scale climate models. I am co-advised by [Nick Lutsko](https://www.sio-climatephysics.com/) and [Shang-Ping Xie](http://sxie.ucsd.edu/). 

Outside of my work, I enjoy baking, running, hiking, and cycling.

**06/25** I presented some preliminary results on the high cloud response to aerosols virtually at the [_2025 CESM Workshop_](https://youtu.be/gJhN4lbjjlY?t=22671). Thanks to the organizers for the opportunity!

**02/25** I presented my recent work on ACI on _Kernel Day_ at the [41st ECS Symposium](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmW1qWBBR9Y&t=2407s). Thanks to the organizers for inviting me!

**02/25** Our paper introducing a new method for diagnosing effective radiative forcing from aerosol-cloud interactions in climate models was just published in _Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics_. [Check it out!](https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/25/2123/2025/)

**06/24** I presented on a new method for diagnosing effective radiative forcing from aerosol-cloud interactions in climate models at the 2024 CFMIP Meeting in Boston College. Thanks to the organizers for having me!

**07/22** I moved down to La Jolla and got started on some intriguing ML & heat wave research! Super excited to start this new chapter.

**04/22** I was awarded the NSF-GRFP! I am beyond thankful for my mentors, advisors, and friends for their support.

**12/21** I presented my PIDGM work at the 2021 AGU Fall Meeting in New Orleans.

**08/21** Wrapped up my final weeks participating in the Earth Science on Volcanic Islands NSF-REU through the University of Hawai'i at MƒÅnoa! I worked on paleoclimate and water isotopes with Dr. Sloan Coats. My final project PIDGM can be seen [here](https://pidgm.github.io/index.html). I presented preliminary work at the 2021 Council on Undergraduate Research (CUR) symposium.

Please reach out to me if you have questions about the grad school application process! I would be happy to share my perspective and answer any questions you might have.
