This is my personal site!

I am a first-year PhD Student in the Climate Sciences (CS) program at Scripps Institution of Oceanography. Most recently, I spent Summer 2021 participating in the Earth Science on Volcanic Islands NSF-REU through the University of Hawai'i at MƒÅnoa, where I was extremely fortunate to get my introduction to paleoclimate under the supervision of Dr. Sloan Coats. My final project PIDGM can be seen [here](https://pidgm.github.io/index.html). I presented my work at the 2021 Council on Undergraduate Research (CUR) symposium and at the 2021 AGU Fall Meeting. I am interested in the application of machine learning to Earth Science contexts.

Outside of school, I enjoy baking, running, hiking, and watching soccer. 

**04/22** I was awarded the NSF-GRFP! I am beyond thankful for my mentors, advisors, and friends for their support.

**04/22** I will be joining the Climate Sciences program at Scripps Insitution of Oceanography in Fall 2022! Beyond excited to get started in San Diego and looking forward to getting into some applied machine learning research!
