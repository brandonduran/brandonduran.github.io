I am a first-year PhD Student in the Climate Sciences (CS) program at Scripps Institution of Oceanography who is interested in the application of machine learning to climate. 

Most recently, I spent Summer 2021 participating in the Earth Science on Volcanic Islands NSF-REU through the University of Hawai'i at MƒÅnoa, where I worked studied paleoclimate, specifically water isotopes, under the supervision of Dr. Sloan Coats. My final project PIDGM can be seen [here](https://pidgm.github.io/index.html). I presented my work at the 2021 Council on Undergraduate Research (CUR) symposium and at the 2021 AGU Fall Meeting.

Outside of school, I enjoy baking, running, hiking, and watching soccer. I have also been getting more into cycling since the pandemic.

**04/22** I was awarded the NSF-GRFP! I am beyond thankful for my mentors, advisors, and friends for their support.

**04/22** I will be joining the Climate Sciences program at Scripps Insitution of Oceanography in Fall 2022! Beyond excited to get started in San Diego and looking forward to getting into some applied machine learning research!


Please reach out to me if you have questions about the grad school application process! I would be happy to share my perspective and answer any questions you might have.
