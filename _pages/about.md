This is my personal site!

I am currently in my final year as an undergraduate at Georgetown University, studying both physics and computer science. Most recently, I spent Summer 2021 participating in the Earth Science on Volcanic Islands NSF-REU through the University of Hawai'i at MƒÅnoa, where I was extremely fortunate to get my introduction to paleoclimate under the supervision of Dr. Sloan Coats.

Outside of school, I enjoy baking, running, hiking, and watching soccer.
